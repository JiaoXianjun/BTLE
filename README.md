BTLE
========

BTLE is a free and open-source Software Defined Radio Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) software suite. 

It includes:
  * btle_rx - BLE sniffer. Besides sniff broadcasting/fixed channel, it can also track channel hopping of a communication link.
  * btle_tx - Universal BLE packet transmitter. Besides BLE standard, it supports also raw bit mode to generate arbitrary GFSK packet. In this way, you can test non-standard protocol or standard under discussion before chip in the market.

Features
---------------

 * PHY and upper layer are implemented in software (C language). Full Software Defined Radio Flexibility. 
 * BLE standard 1Mbps GFSK PHY.
 * All ADV and DATA channel link layer packet formats in Core_V4.0 (Chapter 2&3, PartB, Volume 6) are supported.
 * Sniffer is capable to parse and track channel hopping pattern automatically, not limited to broadcasting channel or fixed channel.

Hardware
--------

 * [HackRF](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf)
 * [bladeRF](https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF)
 * [compatible version of HackRF and bladeRF libraries](compatible_hackrf_bladerf_lib.txt)

Build and Quick test
------------------

Make sure your SDR hardware environment (driver/lib) has been setup correctly before run this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/BTLE.git
cd BTLE/host
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../                   (default. for HackRF)
cmake ../ -DUSE_BLADERF=1   (only for bladeRF)

make
./btle-tools/src/btle_rx
```
Above command sniffs on channel 37. You should see many packets on screen if you have BLE devices (phone/pad/laptop) around.
```
./btle-tools/src/btle_tx 37-DISCOVERY-TxAdd-1-RxAdd-0-AdvA-010203040506-LOCAL_NAME09-SDR/Bluetooth/Low/Energy r500 
```
Above command transmits discovery packets on ADV channel. You should see a device with name "SDR/Bluetooth/Low/Energy" in another BLE sniffer App (such as LightBlue).

**To have a faster operation sequence on HACKRF**, use following:
```
#define TRANSFER_COUNT 4
#define TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE 4096
```
in hackrf/host/libhackrf/src/hackrf.c. Then re-compile the HACKRF lib and re-install it. Don't forget to re-compile BTLE to take the HACKRF lib change.

**Besides the tools, [matlab](matlab) directory includes algorithm evaluation and other useful scirpts**

btle_rx usage
------------------
```
-h --help
```
Print all arguments/usages.
```
-c --chan
```
Channel number. Default value 37 (one of ADV channels). Valid value 0~39 (all ADV and DATA channels).
```
-g --gain
```
Rx gain in dB. HACKRF rxvga default 6, valid 0 - 62. bladeRF default is max rx gain 66dB (valid 0 - 66). Gain should be tuned very carefully to ensure best performance under your circumstance. Suggest test from low gain, because high gain always causes severe distortion and get you nothing.
```
-l --lnaGain
```
LNA gain in dB (HackRF only). Default 32, valid 0 - 40. Gain should be tuned very carefully to ensure best performance under your circumstance. 
```
-b --amp
```
Enable amp (HackRF only). Default off.
```
-a --access
```
Access address. Default 8e89bed6 for ADV channel 37 38 39. You should specify correct value for data channel according to captured connection setup procedure.
```
-k --crcinit
```
Default 555555 for ADV channel. You should specify correct value for data channel according to captured connection setup procedure.
```
-v --verbose
```
Verbose mode. Print more information when there is error
```
-r --raw
```
Raw mode. After access addr is detected, print out following raw 42 bytes (without descrambling, parsing)
```        
-f --freq_hz (need argument)
```
This frequency (Hz) will override channel setting (In case someone want to work on freq other than BTLE. More general purpose).
```
-m --access_mask (need argument)
```
If a bit is 1 in this mask, corresponding bit in access address will be taken into packet existing decision (In case someone want a shorter/sparser unique word to do packet detection. More general purpose).
```
-o --hop
```
This will turn on data channel tracking (frequency hopping) after link setup information is captured in ADV_CONNECT_REQ packet on ADV channel.
```
-s --filename
```
Store packets to pcap file.

btle_tx usage
------------------
```
btle_tx packet1 packet2 ... packetX ...  rN
```
or 
```
btle_tx packets.txt
```
packets.txt is a text file which has command line parameters (packet1 packet2 ... rN) text. One parameter one line. A line start with "#" is regarded as comment. See [packets.txt example](host/btle-tools/src/packets.txt)
```
packetX 
```
is one string which describes one packet. All packets compose a packets sequence.
```
rN
```
means the sequence will be repeated for N times. If it is not specified, the sequence will only be sent once.

packetX string format
```    
channel_number-packet_type-field-value-field-value-...-Space-value
```
Each descriptor string starts with BTLE channel number (0~39), then followed by packet_type (RAW/iBeacon/ADV_IND/ADV_DIRECT_IND/etc. See all format examples [**AT THE END: Appendix**](#appendix-packet-descriptor-examples-of-btle_tx-for-all-formats) ), then followed by field-value pair which is packet_type specific, at last there is Space-value pair (optional) where the value specifies how many millisecond will be waited after this packet sent.

**DO NOT** use space character " " in a command line packet descriptor. You CAN use space in the txt file packet descriptor.

**DO NOT** use "-" inside each field. "-" is magic character which is used to separate different fields in packet descriptor. 


* **btle_tx example: [Discovery packets](host/btle-tools/src/packets_discovery.txt)**

Open LightBlue APP (or other BLE sniffer) in your iPhone/device before this command:
```
./btle-tools/src/btle_tx ../btle-tools/src/packets_discovery.txt
```
You will see a device named as "SDR Bluetooth Low Energy" in your LightBlue APP.

Corresponding Command line:
```
./btle-tools/src/btle_tx 37-DISCOVERY-TxAdd-1-RxAdd-0-AdvA-010203040506-LOCAL_NAME09-SDR/Bluetooth/Low/Energy r40
``` 
Note: space " " is replaced by "/" because space " " is not supported in command line.


* **btle_tx example: [Connection establishment](doc/TI-BLE-INTRODUCTION.pdf)**
```
btle_tx 37-ADV_IND-TxAdd-0-RxAdd-0-AdvA-90D7EBB19299-AdvData-0201050702031802180418-Space-1      37-CONNECT_REQ-TxAdd-0-RxAdd-0-InitA-001830EA965F-AdvA-90D7EBB19299-AA-60850A1B-CRCInit-A77B22-WinSize-02-WinOffset-000F-Interval-0050-Latency-0000-Timeout-07D0-ChM-1FFFFFFFFF-Hop-9-SCA-5-Space-1     9-LL_DATA-AA-60850A1B-LLID-1-NESN-0-SN-0-MD-0-DATA-XX-CRCInit-A77B22-Space-1
```
Above simulates a Connection establishment procedure between device 1 and device 2. Corresponding descriptor file [BTLE/host/btle-tools/src/packets.txt](host/btle-tools/src/packets.txt).

The 1st packet -- device 1 sends ADV_IND packet in channel 37.

The 2nd packet -- After device 2 (in scanning state) receives the ADV packet from device 1, device 2 sends CONNECT_REQ packet to request connection setup with device 1. In this request packet, there are device 2 MAC address (InitA), target MAC address (device 1 MAC address AdvA), Access address (AA) which will be used by device 1 in following packet sending in data channel, CRC initialization value for following device 1 sending packet, Hopping channel information (ChM and Hop) for data channel used by device 1, etc.

The 3rd packet -- device 1 send an empty Link layer data PDU in channel 9 (decided by hopping scheme) according to those connection request information received from device 2. ("XX" after field "DATA" means there is no data for this field )

Time space between packets are 1s (1000ms). Tune TI's packet sniffer to channel 37, then above establishment procedure will be captured.


* **btle_tx example: [iBeacon](doc/ibeacon.pdf)**
```
./btle-tools/src/btle_tx 37-iBeacon-AdvA-010203040506-UUID-B9407F30F5F8466EAFF925556B57FE6D-Major-0008-Minor-0009-TxPower-C5-Space-100     r100
```
Above command sends iBeacon packet and repeats it 100 times with 100ms time space. Corresponding descriptor file [BTLE/host/btle-tools/src/packets_ibeacon.txt](host/btle-tools/src/packets_ibeacon.txt). You can use a BLE sniffer dongle to see the packet.
